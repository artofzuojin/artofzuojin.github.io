            <div class="lineBreak"> </div>
            <h3 style="text-indent:50px;"> Zuo started drawing as a young man, and along the way he formed a passion in fine arts, particularly painting. 
                    initially Zuo learned water and ink techniques, and won his first Chinese national painting prize at the age of 19 but 
                    Zuo had always been curious and inspired by oil painting, and up to that point he was self-taught. In order to augment his skills, 
                    he enrolled in the China Central Academy of Arts, China’s most prestigious art institution, in 2003.

            <h3 style="text-indent:50px;"> While pursing his art studies, Zuo worked in the animation department of a Chinese provincial television station. 
                There he discovered his new fascination, animation.  He later founded Shenbi Animation company in 2008 in China.

            <div class="lineBreak"> </div>
            <h3 style="text-indent:50px;"> Zuo applies his personality and life experience to his paintings. He constantly challenges himself, 
                experimenting with new styles and techniques, all the while, exploring and discovering himself as an artist and human being.  
                Zuo was never satisfied with the status quo. Throughout his 30 years of art career, Zuo has painted landscapes, portraits, 
                and became most interested in examining symbols and exploring expressions of metaphors in his works. 
                Zuo’s works won favorable comments from art experts and critics in China and Internationally.  Dozens of his artworks have been collected and 
                published by art associations, art institutes and magazines.</h3>
